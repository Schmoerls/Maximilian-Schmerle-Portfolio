        "Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter the bottom and sides of each layer-cake pan with the softened butter, using your hands, then sprinkle the flour inside and shake this around so you get a thin coating on the butter. Tip out any excess.",
        "Now to sift your flour. Lay a large piece of waxed paper on a board, put a dry measuring cup in the center, hold a sifter directly over it, scoop cake flour from the package into the sifter, and sift the flour directly into the cup. When the cup is full, draw the back of a knife blade lightly across the top of the cup (don’t shake the flour down, or it will become dense) and then tip the measured flour into a mixing bowl. Repeat with the other 2 cups of flour (you can put any flour that spilled onto the waxed paper back in the sifter).",
        "When you have 3 cups of sifted flour in the bowl, put the baking powder and salt in the sifter, holding it over the mixing bowl, and sift it over the flour. Then mix the baking powder and salt lightly with the flour, using your hands.",
        "Next, Put the butter into a second, large mixing bowl. If it is very firm (it shouldn’t be, if you have left it out of the refrigerator), squeeze it through your fingers until it softens up. When it is soft enough to work, form your right hand into a big fork, as it were, and cream the butter—which means that you beat it firmly and quickly with your hand, beating and aerating it, until it becomes light, creamy, and fluffy.",
        "Then whirl your fingers around like a whisk so the butter forms a circle in the bowl. Gradually cream the 2 cups of sugar into the butter with the same fork-like motion, beating until the mixture is very light and fluffy. As the sugar blends in it will change the color of the butter to a much lighter color, almost white.",
        "Now wash and dry your hands thoroughly and separate the eggs, as you would for a souffle, letting the whites slip through your slightly parted fingers into a small bowl and dropping the yolks into a second, larger bowl. Beat the yolks for a few minutes with a whisk until they are well blended.",
        "Then, again with your hand, beat them very thoroughly into the butter-sugar mixture. Now beat in the milk alternately with the sifted flour—first one, then the other—this time keeping your fingers close together as if your hand were a wooden spatula. Beat, beat, beat until the batter is well mixed, then add the vanilla and beat that in for a minute or two.",
        "Put the egg whites in your beating bowl and beat them with a large whisk or an electric hand beater until they mount first to soft, drooping peaks and then to firm, glossy peaks. Do not overbeat until they are stiff and dry.",
        "Tip the beaten whites onto the cake batter and fold them in with your hand. Slightly cup your hand and use the side like a spatula to cut down through the whites and batter to the bottom of the bowl and then flop them over with your cupped hand, rotating the bowl with your other hand as you do so—exactly the technique you use when folding egg whites into a soufflé mixture with a rubber spatula.",
        "Repeat this very lightly and quickly until the whites and batter are thoroughly folded and blended. Once you have mastered this hand technique you can use it for a soufflé, too.",
        "Again using your hand like a spatula, pour and scrape the batter into the three prepared pans, dividing it equally between them. Give the filled pans a little knock on the countertop to level the batter.",
        "Put the three pans in the center of the oven, or, if you have to use more than one rack, stagger them on the two middle racks of the oven so they do not overlap.",
        "Bake for 25 minutes, then touch the center of each cake lightly with your fingertip. If it springs back, it is done. Remove the pans from the oven and put them on wire cake racks to cool for a few minutes, then loosen the layers by running the flat of a knife blade around the sides of the pans, put a rack on top of each pan, and invert so the cake comes out onto the rack, top side down. Then reverse the layers so they are top side up.",
        "Mix the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar, and orange rind together and drizzle the mixture over the still-warm cake layers, being careful not to let it all soak into one spot; then pile the layers on top of each other.",
        "The juice mixture will give the cake a lovely, fresh, fruity flavor and it is not rich like an icing.",
        "Leave the cake to cool."

Spread the bread crumb mixture evenly over the beef, leaving a ½-inch border along the side farthest from you; press and gently pack the stuffing mixture onto the beef to keep it in place (you may have a little stuffing left over–it makes a great panini filling). Starting from the side nearest you, roll up the meat like a jelly roll, pressing any stuffing that falls out of the ends back into the roll, and tie tightly with the twine, spacing the ties evenly (it’s easier if you have a friend to tie the beef while you hold the roll together). Wrap tightly in plastic wrap to make a compact roll, and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or as long as overnight.",

Stir enough broth into sauce to give it an easily spoonable consistency. Taste and season with additional salt if you think the sauce needs it. Spoon the sauce over the meatballs, decorate with extra mint leaves, if you wish, and carry to the table.",
        "Though pork is most common in Mexico, you can make these from beef or a combination of beef and pork. Lamb can be worked into the mix too. Turkey is what will appeal to most people looking for the leanest dish. The bacon adds just the right tough to succulence and savor, so I’d fight to keep it in, even though the meatballs will turn out fine without it. Mint adds the traditional touch, but parsley, thyme (not too much), sage and basil are all delicious in meatballs."

      "instruction": [
        "In the bowl of a stand mixer, or a large mixing bowl if preparing the dough by hand, sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk. Stir in the 1½ teaspoons of sugar and let the yeast proof for 5 to 7 minutes, until foamy and bubbling. Add 1 cup flour and the salt, beating with the paddle attachment or a wooden spoon to make a soft, smooth batter, about 5 minutes.",
        "Beat in the remaining 4½ cups flour and the 6 tablespoons sugar in three additions, beating in 2 eggs after each addition of flour. Mix well between additions, making sure you scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat until a smooth, soft and elastic dough is formed, about 10 minutes with the dough hook attachment, or 20 to 25 minutes by hand. I actually like to turn the dough out of the mixer at this point and hand-knead. The technique is simple (and great for relieving stress—cheaper than a therapist!). Slap the dough onto the counter, then with the heel of one hand push it through the middle into the counter. With the other hand, fold the far side of the blob towards you, over onto itself, and rotate the dough about 90 degrees. Repeat this pushing, folding and rotating cycle several times, then give the dough another good hard slap onto the counter. (Don’t add any extra flour at this point, even if the dough feels sticky; just use a dough scraper to gather the dough off the work surface. As the dough becomes more elastic, it will lose its gumminess and become smooth.) Do a stretch test: pinch some of the dough and pull it upwards. When the dough is ready, it should feel springy and elastic.",
        "If you have removed your dough from the stand mixer, return it to a clean mixer bowl. If you are preparing the dough entirely by hand, you may find the next step easier in a large mixing bowl with a wooden spoon. Knead or beat the butter into the dough in small portions, fully incorporating each addition before adding the next. This process is definitely easier with a dough hook, but it is not impossible by hand. Squeeze the first few additions of butter through the dough, kneading until it is absorbed, then use a wooden spoon to beat in the remaining additions to prevent the dough from getting greasy and slippery, a sign that the butter is melting and not getting properly incorporated. The butter should be malleable, but not overly soft, and the dough should not get too warm during this process.",
        "When the last of the butter has been beaten in, continue beating the dough until it is very smooth, glossy and elastic, about 5 minutes with the dough hook, or 10 minutes by hand. The dough should now have reached the “clean-up stage”—it should come away from the sides of the bowl in a smooth entity, or should neatly roll on the counter, no longer sticky or tacky. Transfer the dough to a large, lightly buttered bowl and cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap. Leave to rise at warm room temperature, away from any draughts (about 75 degrees is perfect), until doubled in bulk, about 1¼ to 2 hours.",
        "Punch the dough down and flip it over, deflating it completely. The buttery side should now be facing up. Cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. Punch the dough down, flip it once more, cover the bowl with plastic and weigh it down with a plate or dish, making sure the dough won’t be able to creep around the sides of the weight and escape the confines of its bowl. (I have seen renegade doughs running rampant over the bottles and jars on refrigerator shelves more than once, and it’s not a mess that you will forget having to clean up! Not to mention the waste of time, energy and perfectly good butter.) Return the bowl to the coldest part of your refrigerator and leave there overnight. If the dough is left longer than 8 hours, check periodically to make sure it has not risen above the bowl; gently punch it down as necessary. The brioche dough may be frozen at this point, wrapped very securely. Allow the dough to thaw in the refrigerator for 4 to 7 hours, then proceed with the shaping, final rising and baking.",
        "Several hours before you plan to bake the brioche, remove the dough from the refrigerator, punch it down and turn it out onto a very lightly floured surface. Invert the bowl over the dough and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. (At this point, the dough can be shaped for other pastries as well.) Meanwhile, butter two 9 × 5-inch metal loaf pans, or two 8-inch fluted brioche moulds (or one of each!) and set aside.",
        "To form two 9 × 5-inch loaves: divide the dough into 6 roughly equal parts and cover 5 of these with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Roll the remaining portion on the counter into a smooth ball, plumping it by caressing the sides of it with your hands from top to bottom, pulling the surface taut and smooth and tucking the excess dough underneath the ball. Set the ball in the end of one of the prepared loaf pans and cover it with plastic while you repeat the process with the remaining pieces of dough. Place 3 balls in each pan, In a row.",
        "To form two 8-inch brioche a tetes: divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Cover 1 portion with plastic wrap while you work with the other. Divide this half into 8 relatively equal portions, then cover 7 of them with plastic. Roll the remaining portion on the counter into a smooth ball as for the 9 × 5-inch loaves above. Place this ball in the bottom of one of the prepared fluted moulds. Repeat the rolling process with 6 of the remaining pieces of dough, setting them around the outside of the mould over the first ball. Roll the last piece into a smooth ball and nestle this into the centre of the circle of balls. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and repeat with the second half of the dough.",
        "Cover the pans loosely with plastic and drape a dishtowel over top. Let the shaped loaves rise in a draught-free place until plumped and risen, but not quite doubled. This last rising can take between 1½ to 2½ hours, as the dough is still chilled from the refrigerator. Keep an eye on the dough and make sure that it does not rise too much, or you will not get as good an oven-spring (the big initial rising in the oven).",
        ". During the last 20 minutes of the final rising, preheat the oven to between 375° and 400°. Brush the plump loaves with the egg-milk glaze and bake them for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they sound hollow when tipped out of their pans and tapped on the bottom. Be careful when handling the hot loaves, as the joints between the sections are still very soft and fragile. As the brioche cools, the loaves will become firm and less delicate.",
        ". Turn the loaves out and cool completely on wire racks before serving or wrapping tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and storing or freezing. The baked brioche can be frozen for up to 2 months, well-wrapped. Thaw at room temperature for about 4 hours."

I have tried a few of the places, but my favorite is #8, also known as The Burning Spot. You can get a beautiful conch salad there, but nine out of ten patrons (almost all local) sit down and order a beer and “scorch”: similar to conch salad but simpler—no tomatoes or peppers, just conch, onion, juices, salt, and hot chiles—lots of hot chiles.

Insert the knife and cut the conch away from the shell. It will slide right out. Cut away the soft viscera and discard. Wash the meaty part of the conch in saltwater or salted water. Drain well."

It’s quite hard work, and after a few minutes it’s easy to see why the average Italian grandmother has arms like Frank Bruno! You’ll know when to stop – it’s when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury. Then all you need to do is wrap it in clingfilm and put it in the fridge to rest for at least half an hour before you use it. Make sure the clingfilm covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges (this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!)."

        "Use some of the melted butter to grease the interior of an 8-quart mixing bowl. Set that bowl aside. Warm the milk in a 1-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Pour the milk into a large mixing bowl and add 8 tablespoons of melted butter (stir it before measuring to incorporate the milk solids). Stir in 1/3 cup sugar along with the honey, salt, and the raisins, if using. Let the milk cool to lukewarm. Dissolve the yeast in ½ cup of warm water with a pinch of sugar and allow it to become bubbly, about 3 minutes. Add the dissolved yeast to the warm milk mixture, along with the eggs. Stir with a wooden spoon to break up the eggs, then stir in enough flour, cup by cup, to create a somewhat stiff, shaggy mass that’s no longer easily stirred.",
        "Using a sturdy rubber spatula, scrape the mass onto a floured surface and knead it until you’ve created a dough that’s smooth and elastic, adding only as much additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. Place the dough into the greased bowl and brush the top with more melted butter. Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled, 2 to 2½ hours. Uncover the dough and punch it down with several swift swats with the back of your hand. Turn the dough over in the bowl and knead gently to redistribute the yeast. Recover the bowl and let the dough rise again until very light and billowy, 1 to 1½ hours.",
        "To shape braided loaves, first line two large, shallow baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle the paper with cornmeal. Gather your choice of seeds, if using, and place them next to the bowl of glaze. Turn the fully risen dough out onto your lightly floured work surface and divide the dough in half using your pastry scraper. Cover one half while working with the other. (If not working with a double oven, refrigerate half of the dough in its original bowl, covered.)",
        "Divide one half of dough into six equal pieces and roll each piece into a strand about 10 inches long, with tapered ends and slightly chubby centers. (Use extra flour, only as necessary, to keep dough from sticking.) Position the strands vertically in front of you and pinch the ends farthest from you at the top together, attaching them. See Notes for braiding instructions.",
        "When you reach the bottom of the braid, pinch the ends together to secure them. Tuck the ends on both sides underneath the braid, plumping it nicely. Place the braid on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise for 30 minutes, preheating the oven to 375 F., for the last 20 minutes of the rise. (If working with a double oven, repeat this same procedure with the remaining half of dough. If not, wait until the first loaf enters the oven to remove the second half from the refrigerator and shape that braid.)",
        "After a 20-minute rise, uncover the braid and brush the dough all over with the egg glaze. Leave the loaf uncovered for the remaining 10 minutes. Just before baking, give the dough another coat of glaze and, if desired, sprinkle the top decoratively with one or more type of the seeds. Sprinkle the top lightly with salt, if desired, and bake the braid(s) until the loaves are golden, feel light, and sound hollow when lifted and tapped on the bottom, 35 to 45 minutes. As the dough bakes it will expand, exposing new, unglazed dough. To prevent uneven browning, check the braids 20 minutes after they enter the oven and, working quickly, brush any whiter parts of dough with some reserved glaze. Quickly sprinkle those sections with some seeds, if using, and continue to bake until done. Cover the top of the braids loosely with aluminum foil (shiny side up) if the loaves begin to become overly brown before being cooked through, uncovering for the last 2 minutes of baking.",
        "Sandwich Loaf:",
        "Brush three 8 × 4-inch loaf pans with melted butter. Go to the Country White Bread recipe, and follow the shaping and rising procedure. Before baking, brush the exposed dough with either melted butter or the egg glaze. If using the glaze, you can then apply some poppy, sesame, or caraway seeds. Bake in a preheated 375°F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Turn the loaves out of their pans and let them cool on wire racks before slicing.",
        "Savory Challah:",
        "When assembling the dough, reduce the sugar to 2 tablespoons, omit the honey, and add ½ cup-thinly sliced chives and ½ cup room-temperature freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for braids or loaves, or 1 cup cheese when making a Brie en croûte. If making a Brie en croute, after the first 2-hour rise, punch the dough down, cover the bowl, and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours and as long as 24 hours before shaping. If using this savory version to be braided or baked in loaf pans, the dough should be at room temperature. Follow the previous topping instructions."

If it seems a little dry and not quite packable, drizzle a teaspoon or so of cold water over the pastry and work it in with your fingertips. Using your hands, pack the pastry into 2 balls, as you would pack a snowball. Make one ball slightly larger than the other; this will be your bottom crust. Knead each ball once or twice, then flatten the balls into ¾-inch-thick disks on a floured work surface. Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before rolling. About 10 minutes before rolling, transfer the pastry to the freezer to make it even firmer.",
        "To mix by hand: Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Toss well, by hand, to mix. Scatter the butter over the dry ingredients; toss. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour until it is broken into pieces the size of split peas. Add the shortening and continue to cut until all of the fat is cut into small pieces. Sprinkle half of the water over the dry mixture; toss well with a fork to dampen the mixture. Add the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to toss and mix, pulling the mixture up from the bottom of the bowl on the upstroke and gently pressing down on the downstroke. Pastry made by hand often needs a bit more water, so add it 1 to 2 teaspoons at a time-if it seems necessary-until the pastry can be packed. Form the pastry into balls, as instructed above, then shape and refrigerate as directed.",
        "Rosemary Semolina Double Crust:",
        "I love this pastry in mixed pear and apple pies. The rosemary gives the crust a wonderful aroma and savory lift and the semolina adds a bit of crunchy texture and relaxes the pastry, which bakes up very tender. Follow the directions above, substituting 1/3 cup fine semolina or fine yellow or white cornmeal for 1/3 cup of the flour. Add ½ teaspoon finely crushed dried rosemary to the dry ingredients and proceed as usual. Note that the pastry may require 1 to 2 tablespoons less water than the basic recipe."

Add the tomatoes, basil, and oregano and continue cooking until slightly thickened and aromatic, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool, then purée the sauce with an immersion blender or in a food processor. Refrigerate until it is needed.",
        "To make the dough, combine the flour and salt in a bowl and stir to mix. Make a well in the center, pour the warm water into the well and sprinkle the yeast over. Set aside until the yeast is frothy, about 5 minutes. Stir the dough for a few moments with a wooden spoon, drawing in the flour from the edges, then drizzle the olive oil over. Continue to stir the dough until it begins to come together in a ball. Transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes, adding a bit more flour if needed. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl (it could be the same bowl in which you mixed the dough) and turn it to evenly but lightly coat with oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.",

Using your palms, press the dough out into a rectangle to get things started, then use a rolling pin to roll the dough to a rectangle about 10 inches by 20 inches. The gluten developed in the dough will resist rolling and spring back at times. If this becomes troublesome, let the dough sit to relax for a few minutes, then continue rolling.",
        "Cut the dough, preferably using a rolling-blade pizza cutter, into 2 1?2-inch squares. Transfer the squares to the baking sheets, with about 1 inch between them. Spread a thin smear of tomato sauce over the squares and top with the pepperoni, a mushroom slice or two, and/or olive slices, finishing with a sprinkling of mozzarella and a few pieces of onion.",
        "Bake until the dough is lightly browned and the cheese is melted, 15 to 17 minutes, switching the sheets halfway through for even cooking. Transfer the pizzas to a platter for serving, setting it on a warming tray to keep warm, if you wish."

Put the remaining ¼ cup or so of jam into a wide saucepan with the lemon juice and melt over a low heat, then tumble in the blackberries and turn in the heat for a minute or so just until the juices start running. Tip these over the biscuit-sprinkled, liqueur-soused sandwiches to cover and leave this while you get on with the next bit.",
        "Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until you have a thick, smooth, yellow paste. I use my KitchenAid for this, but any old handheld electric mixer or whisk would be fine. Still whisking, drip in another ¼ cup limoncello and continue whisking away until you have a light moussey mixture. Whisk in the mascarpone until everything is smoothly combined, and when this is done add the remaining limoncello. Finally, in another bowl, whisk the egg whites until firm, but not dry, and fold these into the lemony, eggy mascarpone mixture. Now spread this gently over the blackberries in the glass bowl.",
        "Cover the thus-far assembled trifle with plastic wrap and leave in the refrigerator for the flavors and textures to steep and meld for at least 4 hours and up to 24. Take the trifle out of the refrigerator for about 40 minutes to an hour before it’s needed (depending on how cold your refrigerator runs) to get to coolish room temperature. Not long before you want to eat, toast the slivered almonds by tossing them in a dry pan over medium heat until they are turning gold and flashed bronze in parts, then tip them onto a plate. When they’re cool, mix them with the reserved amaretti crumbs. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl and scatter the nuts and crumbs over the pale, set surface. Dig in and serve, making sure to heap the full triple-banded layer on each plate: the lemony, almondy, cream-swathed berriness makes this the perfect ending to a large, lazy summer lunch."

Quickly slip the sheets of unbaked cookies into the freezer for 15 minutes before moving them into the oven. This will help to prevent the shapes from distorting or spreading. Bake for 9 – 15 minutes, taking into a account how small or thin the animal shapes are and keeping an eye on the cookies so that they don’t burn.

Liquid will begin to seep from the cabbage. The extracted water should cover the cabbage entirely. If not, add brine to cover. Be sure the level of the liquid stays 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the jar rim to allow for expansion. Press the mixture down and keep it under the brine by placing a plate or a lid on top, weighted down by a clean rock or resealable plastic bag filled with water.",

        "To make the tart dough, combine all of the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food processor, and pulse once or twice to combine. Add the butter cubes to the bowl. Pulse until the dough forms into large crumbles, being careful not to overmix, about 30 pulses. Add the ice water to the bowl and turn the processor on, mixing until the dough is just combined and comes together in 2 or 3 large portions. This only takes about 8 to 10 seconds, so be mindful not to overprocess. Turn the dough out onto the countertop and press into a flat round disk (about 6 inches wide). Work quickly and don’t handle the dough too much. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours, or until you’re ready to roll it out.",
        "Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the dough into a 10-inch round, making sure to rotate and flip it over, rolling both sides. Fold it in half loosely and place it over a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, the crease of the dough running down the middle of the pan, and the edges overhanging slightly. Unfold the dough so it hangs over the edge of the tart pan. Press the dough gently into the corners of the pan, being careful not to stretch it thin. Fold under any overhanging crust, and press it into the walls of tart pan. Run a rolling pin over the top of the pan, pressing down to trim any extra dough and make it flush with top edge of the pan. Use a fork to pierce the bottom of the tart shell, and freeze for 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Take the tart shell from the freezer and line it with parchment paper. Fill the parchment paper with pie weights or beans, pressing them into the corners. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the pie weights and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the shell from the oven and cool for at least 15 minutes, or until you’re ready to use it.",
        "To prepare the filling: When you’re ready to make the filling, be sure the oven is preheated to 350 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy and white, about 5 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, and mix well to combine. Add the ground almonds, flour, and salt; mix together until well combined.",
        "Spread the filling into the pre-baked tart shell. Press the apple slices into the almond filling, slightly overlapping them and working in a circle from the outside of the tart to the center. Sprinkle with the demerara sugar and bake until the apples are golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool before serving."

Put the olive oil and butter in a separate large pan, add the onion and celery and cook very gently for about 15 minutes, without coloring, until soft. Add the rice (it will sizzle!) and turn up the heat. Don't let the rice or veg catch on the bottom of the pan, so keep it moving.",

        "Stage 3: Add the stock to the rice a ladle at a time, stirring and waiting until it has been fully absorbed before adding the next. Turn the heat down to low so the rice doesn't cook too quickly, otherwise the outside of each grain will be stodgy and the inside hard and nutty (you don't want to cook it too slowly either, or it will turn into rice pudding!), and continue to add ladlefuls of stock until it has all been absorbed. This should take about 14 to 15 minutes and give you rice that is beginning to soften but is still a little al dente.",
        "Stage 4: Tip the part-cooked rice out on to the waiting oiled tray. Spread it all out evenly, about 2.5cm/1 inch thick, on the tray and then put it somewhere cold to cool down. When the rice has lost all its heat, scrape it up carefully with a rubber spatula and store it in a tupperware container with a lid in the fridge until you're ready to use it. It will keep for a couple of days.",

Stirring all the time, gently bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer until almost all the stock has been absorbed. Add the rest of the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is cooked. You might not need all your stock. Be careful not to overcook the rice – check it throughout cooking to make sure it’s a pleasure to eat. It should hold its shape but be soft, creamy and oozy. And the overall texture should be slightly looser than you think you want it.",
        "Turn off the heat, beat in your butter, Parmesan, gorgonzola, goat’s cheese, chopped apple and marjoram. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed. Put a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute so the cheese can really ooze into it. While you’re waiting, gently heat the walnuts in a pan. Then either take the risotto to the table and let everyone help themselves, or divide it between individual serving plates. Put a block of Parmesan on the table for grating over. Sprinkle with the walnuts and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil before tucking in."

You can do this by hand with a strong arm and a sturdy spoon, or with your stand mixer and the paddle attachment pulsed on low speed.",

With floured clean hands, gently shape 1 portion of the dough on the parchment paper into a rectangle that is 12 inches long and 10 inches wide. Spread half (about % cup) of the filling over the dough, evenly coating the surface.",
        "Now for rolling up! Turn the paper so that the long side of the rectangle is nearest you. Begin rolling, using the parchment to lift the dough and roll it over onto itself. The parchment is a great aid in allowing you to roll up the dough with ease, gracefully turning the rectangle into a snug cylinder. Transfer the cylinder to the prepared baking pan with the help of the parchment paper: Simply pick up the parchment paper while supporting the dough and set them both right on the sheet pan. (You can keep the parchment paper underneath your dough while baking.) Repeat with the second portion of dough.",
        "Next comes the really artful and exciting part! With a pair of clean scissors, make 3 or 4 incisions on top of each cylinder. Approach the dough at a 45 degree angle and make cuts like the letter V. Be sure to start your incisions at least 2 inches in from each end, and space them evenly. Bake for 1 hour and 50 minutes, until golden brown .and crusty. When cooled, frost with vanilla frosting or dust with sifted powdered evaporated cane juice."

        "Using a paper towel, lightly grease the bottom and sides of the loaf pan with solid shortening. Dust generously with all-purpose flour, shake to distribute, and tap out the excess.",
        "Ingredient Preparations: Pour the flour and salt into a triple sifter. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to distribute the salt evenly and to remove any lumps in the flour.",
        "Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk together just enough to combine yolks and whites. Add the vanilla and almond extract and stir to combine.",
        "Grate only the colored portion from the lemon and orange rind for their zests; set aside.",
        "Place the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer.",
        "Making the Cake: With the flat beater (paddle), cream the butter on medium speed (#5) until it is lighter in color, clings to the sides of the mixing bowl, and has a satiny appearance (this should take 30 to 45 seconds).",
        "Maintaining the same speed, add the sugar in a steady stream. When all the sugar is added, stop the machine and scrape the mixture clinging to the sides into the center of the bowl. Continue to cream at the same speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mixture is very light in color and fluffy in appearance.",
        "With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in eggs, cautiously at first, tablespoon by tablespoon, as if you were adding oil when making mayonnaise. If at any time the mixture appears watery or shiny, stop the flow of eggs, and increase the speed until a smooth, silken appearance returns. Then decrease the speed to medium, and resume adding eggs.",
        "Continue to cream, stopping the mixer and scraping the sides of the bowl at least once. When the mixture appears almost white and fluffy and has increased in volume (about 2 to 2½ minutes), detach the beater and bowl. Tap the beater against the edge of the bowl to free the excess. Stir in the lemon and orange zests with a rubber spatula.",
        "Stir in about one-third of the flour at a time. Scrape the sides of the bowl often and mix until smooth after each addition.",
        "Baking the Cake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. With a rubber spatula, spread the batter, working from the center outward and creating a slightly raised ridge around the outside rim of the pan. (Even though the batter is manipulated so it is higher around the edges and lower in the center, this cake will still peak and crack in the center as it bakes as a result of aeration. This is characteristic of a heavy batter.)",
        "Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out free of cake. The cake, with its crust golden, should begin to contract from the pan sides.",
        "Cooling the Cake: Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. With mitts, tilt and rotate pan, and gently tap it on the counter to see if the cake is releasing from the metal sides. If not, or if in doubt, run a small metal spatula or the thin blade of a table knife between the outer cake edge and the metal rim, freeing the sides and allowing air to get under the cake as it is rotated.",
        "Cover the cake with a cooling rack, invert it onto the rack, and carefully lift pan to remove it. Cover with another rack, invert the cake, right side up, and remove the original rack. Cool completely.",
        "Making the Filling: No more than 30 minutes before filling the cake, begin the apricot filling, if desired. Proceed to cut the pound cake as directed below.",
        "Place the apricots in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan. Pour the water over them and allow to soak for 5 minutes. Then, over medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until almost all the water is evaporated (about 5 to 7 minutes). While the mixture is warm, spoon it into a food processor fitted with the metal blade, and process until it has a sticky paste consistency.",
        "Filling the Cake: Once the cake has completely cooled, place it on the counter. With a 12-inch serrated knife, trim the top of the cake to make it level. Then turn it upside down, making the top of the cake the base.",
        "With the tip of a small paring knife, lightly trace a V on one short end of the cake, beginning at the corners of the seam (that is, where the sides meet the top) and ending just below the middle of the cake. Each side or leg of the V should be about 2½ inches long (depending on the size of your cake, of course). Turn the cake around, and do the same to the other end of the loaf.",
        "Insert the paring knife into the lines you have traced to the depth of about ½ inch. Do this to every corner of the cake. These notches will serve as a guide for cutting a deep V-shaped piece that will be lifted out of the pound cake.",
        "Position the cake directly in front of you, with one of its short ends parallel to the edge of the counter. Taking the right side first, insert a 12-inch serrated knife into both notches, and slowly saw diagonally down that side of the V. Check often to ensure that the knife is staying in the notch and following the correct angle. Turn the cake around, and repeat the procedure on the other side. Carefully lift the triangular portion from the body of the cake, and set aside.",
        "Using a metal spatula, spread a thin, even film of the dried apricot filling into the valley you have created in the cake. Then replace the triangular piece, pressing down gently to fit it into place. The filling should not be too apparent, and the cake should look almost as it did before being cut."

        "Preheat the oven to 425°F. This is because the easiest way to poach the salmon for this dish is to do it in the oven. So: pour the water into a roasting pan, add the lime leaves and then the salmon. Cover the pan with foil, put in the oven and cook for about 15 minutes, by which time the salmon should be tender. Remove the pan from the oven and drain the liquid off into a pitcher. Keep the fish warm simply by replacing the foil on the pan.",
        "Melt the butter in a wide, heavy saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid, and add the oil to stop the butter burning. Soften the onion in the pan and add the spices, then keep cooking till the onion is slightly translucent and suffused with the soft perfume of the spices. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon so that it’s all well coated. There’s not enough onion to give a heavy coating: just make sure the rice is fragrantly slicked.",
        "Pour in the reserved liquid from the pitcher—about 2¼ cups—and stir before covering with the lid and cooking gently for about 15 minutes. If your stove is vociferous you may need a flame tamer.",
        "At the end of the cooking time, when the rice is tender and has lost all chalki-ness, turn off the heat, remove the lid, cover the pan with a dish towel and then replace the lid. This will help absorb any extra moisture from the rice. It is also the best way to let the rice stand without getting sticky or cold, which is useful when you’ve got a few friends and a few dishes to keep your eye on.",
        "Just before you want to eat, drain off any extra liquid that’s collected in the dish with the salmon, then flake the fish with a fork. Add to it the rice, eggs, cilantro, lime juice and a drop or two of fish sauce. Stir gently to mix—I use a couple of wooden paddles or spatulas—and taste to see if you want any more lime juice or fish sauce. Sprinkle over the zest from the two juiced halves of the lime and serve. I love it served just as it is in the roasting dish, but if you want to, and I often do (consistency is a requirement of a recipe but not a cook), decant into a large plate before you add the lime zest, then surround with lime segments and add the zest and a small handful of freshly chopped cilantro.",
        "This is one of those rare dishes that manages to be comforting and light at the same time. And- should you have leftovers, which I wouldn't count on--it's heavenly eaten, as all leftovers demand to be, standing up, straight from the fridge."

        "Finely chop your asparagus stalks into tiny discs, keeping the tips whole. Make your Basic Risotto recipe. Then put a large saucepan on a medium to high heat and pour in half the stock, followed by all your risotto base and the finely sliced asparagus stalks and the tips. Stirring all the time, gently bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer until almost all the stock has been absorbed. Add the rest of the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice and asparagus are cooked. You might not need all your stock. Be careful not to overcook the rice – check it throughout cooking to make sure it’s a pleasure to eat. It should hold its shape but be soft, creamy and oozy, and the overall texture should be slightly looser than you think you want it.",
        "Turn off the heat, beat in your butter and Parmesan, mint, almost all the lemon zest and all the juice. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed. Put a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil, a scattering of lemon zest and a block of Parmesan on the table.",
        "Basic Risotto:",
        "Stage 1: Have a large oiled tray to hand. Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan. Put the olive oil and butter in a separate large pan, add the onion and celery and cook very gently for about 15 minutes, without coloring, until soft. Add the rice (it will sizzle!) and turn up the heat. Don't let the rice or veg catch on the bottom of the pan, so keep it moving.",
        "Stage 2: Quickly pour in the vermouth or wine. You will smell the alcohol immediately, so keep stirring all the time until it has evaporated, leaving the rice with a lovely perfume.",
        "Stage 3: Add the stock to the rice a ladle at a time, stirring and waiting until it has been fully absorbed before adding the next. Turn the heat down to low so the rice doesn't cook too quickly, otherwise the outside of each grain will be stodgy and the inside hard and nutty (you don't want to cook it too slowly either, or it will turn into rice pudding!), and continue to add ladlefuls of stock until it has all been absorbed. This should take about 14 to 15 minutes and give you rice that is beginning to soften but is still a little al dente.",
        "Stage 4: Tip the part-cooked rice out on to the waiting oiled tray. Spread it all out evenly, about 2.5cm/1 inch thick, on the tray and then put it somewhere cold to cool down. When the rice has lost all its heat, scrape it up carefully with a rubber spatula and store it in a tupperware container with a lid in the fridge until you're ready to use it. It will keep for a couple of days."

Add a dash of salt, and when the water boils, add the asparagus in one or two layers. Bring back to the boil, and cover, so the spears come back to a boil very quickly. After 4 or 5 minutes, the asparagus should be tender but still firm. Remove the lid, drain off the water, and spread the spears on a tray to cool if not serving right away, so they cool quickly and retain their beautiful color. I don’t like to rinse asparagus under cold water, as it waters down the taste. Yet, if I cook a large quantity, I cool it down briefly under cold water and drain while still warm, so any remaining moisture evaporates.",
        "It is easy and quick to make the hazelnut sauce in a blender. Melt the butter in a saucepan. As it cooks, it will foam a little, and then the foam will disappear and the solids will stick a little to the bottom of the pan, creating a darkish coating. The butter will turn a rich, very light brown color with a pleasant hazelnut taste. Let the butter cool for 5 minutes before using because if it is too hot it may curdle the yolks. Put the egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water in a blender, turn the blender on, and with it running, pour the butter into it in a slow, steady stream. Add the lemon juice, a dash of salt, and a little cayenne pepper, and process for a few more seconds. The mixture should be smooth, creamy, and have a delicious flavor.",
        "To serve: reheat the asparagus (if necessary) in a microwave oven for about a minute, or place in a conventional oven for a few minutes at 180°F to warm it. Sprinkle the reserved croutons on top, and serve right away with the hazelnut sauce. It is said that the sulfur in asparagus gives a metallic taste to wine, especially red wine, but it takes more than that to prevent me from enjoying wine with this dish."

Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside.",

When the liquid is simmering, gradually sprinkle the polenta over in a very slow, thin stream, whisking constantly in the same direction until all the grains have been incorporated and no lumps remain. Reduce the heat to low. Switch to a wooden paddle and stir every 1 or 2 minutes for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan and the grains of polenta have softened. Add the prosciutto mixture and pepper to taste. Add the Parmesan and butter, stirring to mix evenly. The mixture will be very thick.",

Mound the polenta in the pan and, using a rubber spatula repeatedly dipped in very hot water, spread the polenta evenly in the pan until it is just under ½ inch thick. Cover with a tea towel and allow to rest for 1 hour at room temperature, or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.",

In two batches if necessary, fry the croutons, nudging occasionally with a spatula to keep them separate, for 8 to 10 minutes, turning once, or until crispy and golden at the edges. With a skimmer, remove the croutons to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the rest and prepare the salad.",

Drizzle the olive oil over the salad and toss gently until the leaves are well coated. Sprinkle on the salt, pepper to taste, and vinegar and toss again briefly to distribute the vinegar evenly. Mound an equal amount of salad on each of 6 or 8 side plates and distribute the warm croutons around the edges of the plates. Serve immediately."

Place the rolled chicken in a large dish and pour the teriyaki over the chicken and sprinkle with lemon pepper. Marinate approximately 3 hours in the refrigerator or 30 minutes at room temperature, turning occasionally.",
        "Add approximately 1 tablespoon of oil (if needed) to the reserved bacon grease and heat over medium heat. Add the rolled breasts (roulades) to the oil and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes total.

Add the shallots and garlic to the skillet with the reserved bacon grease and sauté on low heat until shallots are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the white wine to the skillet and increase the heat to medium. The wine will boil, loosening the browned bits that contribute to the sauce’s flavor. Boil until the wine reduces by half. Add the stock and bring back to a boil. Boil 10 minutes until mixture reduces slightly. Add the cream and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and continue to whisk.

Add the remaining 6 tablespoons (85 grams) butter and the rest of the sugar to the pan and, when the butter is bubbling, toss in the apple slices. Cook the apples, stirring frequently, until they are lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in the Calvados, turn off the heat, and carefully touch a match to the liquid. When the flames die down, pull the pan from the stove.",

Toss the lemon slices with the onion mixture, add the white wine, and set aside to let the onions soften and “weep” their moisture while you trim the artichokes.",
        "Trim the bottom of the stem of each artichoke and carefully peel the stalk. Remove badly damaged or dry outer leaves. Trim the thorns with scissors or slice them off with a sharp paring knife. Cut the artichoke in half, then use a stainless steel spoon to carve under and remove the thistley choke, leaving the meaty bottom intact. Rinse in cold water; don’t drain well—a little water between the leaves helps ensure that the artichokes cook thoroughly and evenly.",
        "Sprinkle the artichokes with salt, squeezing and folding them so some salt falls between the leaves. Drizzle and rub with olive oil to coat thoroughly, then squeeze the halves so you can trickle and rub some oil between the leaves.",
        "Spread the juicy onion mixture about 1- ½ inches deep in a large, flameproof baking dish (I use a 10- by 14-inch lasagna pan). The liquid should be about ½ inch deep; if not, add a little water. (This puddle will generate steam to keep the artichokes moist as they cook.) Nestle the artichokes cut side down in the bed of onions. They will be crowded.",
        "Heat gently over a low flame until the puddle is bubbling, then cover tightly—first with parchment paper, then foil, dull side out—and bake until you can easily pull out a second-tier leaf and the pulp at its base is tender. This usually takes about 1-1 ½ hours; the exact size of the artichokes, as well as the baking dish and oven performance, will affect the cooking time. Be aware that the outermost layer of leaves will emerge a little leathery, which I like.",
        "Once a test leaf is tender, raise the oven temperature to 400°, uncover, and bake for about 15 minutes longer to concentrate the flavors and lightly brown the tips of the vegetables. Serve hot, warm, or cold, as is, or with homemade mayonnaise flavored with lemon, garlic, or a few chopped anchovy fillets.",
        "Cover any leftovers tightly and refrigerate; they will be silkier and sweeter the next day. Bring to room temperature before serving, or heat slowly, loosely covered, in a 300° oven."

        "Make a simple tomato sauce. Warm the olive oil with the bay leaf, basil, parsley, onion, and garlic, and cook slowly for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, raise the heat to medium high, and cook until they are quite soft and broken apart, about 15 minutes. Pass them through a food mill; then return the sauce to the pan, and simmer until quite thick. If needed, add a pinch or two of sugar to balance the acidity, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. This should make 1½ cups.",
        "While the sauce is cooking, bring 4½ cups water to a boil and add 1½ teaspoons salt. Whisk in the cornmeal in a stream so that lumps don't form, and when it has all been added, switch to a wooden spoon, lower the heat, and stir for 15 minutes. Pour it into a loaf pan or a 9-by-12-inch baking dish, and set it aside to cool. When it is thoroughly cool and firm, turn it out and slice it into pieces about ½ inch thick and about 3 inches long. If a loaf pan was used, cut the pieces again, diagonally.",
        "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly butter a gratin dish, and spread about 1 cup of the tomato sauce over the bottom. Arrange the polenta and the slices of Fontina in overlapping layers. Carefully spoon the remaining tomato sauce over the layers in a decorative way, leaving bands of red sauce between the yellow polenta and cheese. Crumble Gorgonzola over the top, pepper generously, and bake the gratin, uncovered, for 25 to 35 minutes. The cheese will melt into the tomato, making a sauce to spoon over the polenta. Garnish with the fresh herbs."

When the oil is hot, put as many meatballs in the skillet as will fit without overcrowding. Brown them until they form a nice crust all around. When one batch is done, transfer it with a slotted spoon to a platter covered with paper towels to drain and do the next batch until all are done.",
        "Make the béchamel: Heat the milk over low heat until it forms a ring of pearly bubbles, but do not let it break into a boil. While the milk is being heated, melt the butter in a separate pan over low heat. When the butter melts, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. When the flour has been wholly amalgamated with the butter, but before it becomes colored, remove from the heat. Add 2 tablespoons of milk at a time to the flour and butter mixture, stirring steadily and thoroughly. Add 2 more tablespoons of milk when the first 2 have been incorporated smoothly and evenly into the butter and flour. Stir and repeat the operation until you have put in 8 tablespoons of milk. At this point you can add the milk ½ cup at a time, always stirring steadily to obtain a homogeneous mixture. When all the milk has been worked in, place the pan over low heat, add the pinch of salt, and stir without interruption until the béchamel is as dense as a thick cream. Add the nutmeg.",

        "Thickly smear the bottom and sides of a 12-inch spring form pan with the butter. Put in the rigatoni, leveling them off with a spatula. Pour the milk over them, spread the rest of the béchamel on top, and sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese.",
        ". Place in the uppermost level of the preheated oven. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until a golden brown crust forms on top.",
        ". Run a knife along the inside of the pan’s ring to loosen the rigatoni. Remove the ring. Place the pasta, without removing it from the bottom of the pan, on a large round platter, allow to settle for about 5 minutes, bring to the table, and serve."

Pour a quarter of this vinaigrette over the chicken breasts, patting it onto the chicken with a fork.

Lightly butter the bread on both sides, put the bread on a large baking sheet, and bake in the oven, turning once, until lightly toasted on both sides. (If using croissants, you can omit this step.) In a small saucepan, whisk together the half-and-half, vanilla, lemon zest, salt, and cinnamon. Heat the mixture over medium heat until just about to simmer. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and 1/3 cup of the brown sugar until smooth. Slowly pour in the warm cream mixture, whisking all the time. This tempers the egg yolks and makes for a more custardy pudding",

Allow to soak for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight in the refrigerator. Into a medium bowl, slice the bananas and toss with the remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar and the lemon juice. Stir this into the bread and custard mixture and pour into the prepared baking dish, making sure that the ingredients are evenly distributed. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar over the top of the pudding.",

Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until the custard is mostly set. It will still be a little jiggly in the center but will set up as the pudding cools. Serve warm or at room temperature with Burnt Almond Caramel Sauce or whipped cream, if using.",

Cook the mixture over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 230°F. Add the wine, cream, espresso powder, vanilla, and almonds very carefully, since the caramel sauce will boil up. Stir over low heat until combined and smooth. Increase the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Store, covered, in the refrigerator.

Immediately pour the crème anglaise through a China cap or fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and whisk until cool. Refrigerate for up to 3 days. Cover after completely cool.",

Cover with a second piece of parchment and then the second pan and bake for about 30 minutes, until the pastry is deep golden and baked through. Turn the stack of pans and pastry over top to bottom every 8 or 10 minutes to ensure even baking. To prevent warping, cool on a rack between pans.",

In a separate pan, heat the cream to a simmer. When the caramel is a deep amber color, remove the pan from the heat and add the hot cream, a quarter at a time, from a ladle held at arm’s length away from the pan of caramel (it spatters far). After all the cream has been added, stir once, replace the pan on the heat, and allow to come to a full boil. Remove from the heat and pour into a heavy bowl or pan to cool.",
        "Shortly before you assemble the dessert, prepare the whipped cream. In a bowl, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla, cover, and set it aside, refrigerated.",
        "Use a sharp, round, 3-inch cutter or a cardboard pattern and a sharp paring knife to cut the baked pastry layer into 3-inch circles (you should end up with 16).",
        "8. To assemble, place the caramel sauce in a squeeze bottle—or use a large spoon—and streak the dessert plates with the sauce. Place a pastry in the center of each plate and top with a large spoonful of the bananas. Pipe or spoon a large dollop of whipped cream over the bananas and cover with another pastry. Press it on gently. Dust the surface of the top pastry disk with confectioners’ sugar. Pass the remaining whipped cream and caramel sauce in bowls. Serving: Serve these as soon as possible after they are assembled. A sweet wine, such as a Sauternes or a French or California late-harvest Riesling would be a wonderful accompaniment to the feuilletes. Storage: Though the desserts cannot be stored, all the elements may be made in advance. If you wish to make the full amount but serve the desserts to fewer people, the leftover caramel sauce will keep well in ajar in the refrigerator—leave it at room temperature for a few hours before you use it. The leftover feuilletés will freeze well wrapped airtight in plastic. Reheat them at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes and let them cool before using them. Hint for Success: As with all plated desserts, have all the elements ready and at hand before you begin to assemble.",

      "instruction": [
        "This grill recipe uses a technique called “indirect cooking” or “indirect grilling.” This simply means that the food is not set directly over the coals or burners as it cooks in a covered grill. Essentially, this is grill roasting—heat rises and reflects off the lid and sides of the grill, circulating the heat. Indirect grilling is used for long, slow cooking; it is the best method for barbecuing whole chickens, roasts, ribs, and turkeys. The directions are for a gas grill with more than one burner, or a charcoal-burning, kettle-style grill with a vented lid.",
        "One hour before you are ready to grill, place the hickory chips in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and soak. In the meantime, secure the legs of the turkey with a 1-foot length of kitchen twine by bringing the legs together, wrapping the string around the ends (knobs) of the legs, and then tying the string with a knot. Trim any extra length of string. Rub or lightly brush the turkey with olive oil. Place the bird, breast-side down, on the roasting rack, and set it inside the disposable roasting pan.",
        "Drain the soaking hickory chips. Make 3 aluminum foil pouches or use the disposable foil pie plate. (Skip this step if your gas grill has a smoker box, and follow the manufacturer’s instruction for using wood chips.) To make the puches, cut three 16-inch-long pieces of heavy-duty foil. Fold each in half to make a pouch about 8 inches long, and fill with one-third of the wood chips. Crimp the edges together to seal, and then poke holes in the top of the pouch. If using a small disposable foil pie plate, fill it with one-third of the chips. (The pie plate will be refilled twice as the chips burn down.)",
        "FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Forty-five minutes prior to grilling, prepare a hardwood charcoal or charcoal briquette fire. When the coals are covered with a gray ash, mound them on one side of the grill. Place 1 pouch or the pie plate of wood chips directly on the coals. Place the roasting pan on the cooking grate near, but not over, the coals. Close the grill lid.",
        "FOR A GAS GRILL Twenty minutes prior to grilling, preheat the grill with all burners on high. Turn off the burner directly below where the turkey will rest, and adjust the other burner(s) to medium-high. Place the drained wood chips in the smoky box, or place 1 pouch or the pie plate of wood chips directly on the heat source. Place the roasting pan on the cooking grate on the side of the gas grill that has been turned off. Close the grill lid.",
        "Grill-roast the turkey for 1 hour. Open the grill lid. Add more wood chips if needed. With a wad of paper towels in each hand, turn the turkey, breast-side up, and arrane it so the leg and wing that were facing the fire are now facing away from it. Continue cooking, with the lid closed, for another 45 minutes. While the turkey is grill-roasting, begin the optional Giblet Gravy by making the stock (recipe follows).",
        "Check the wood chips and add more, if needed. Turn the turkey once again so that the leg and wing that were facing the fire are now facing away from it. Continue cooking, with the lid closed, for another 45 minutes. Using an instant-read thermometer, check the internal temperature of the turkey by placing the thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh. Check both thighs. When the thermometer registers 165 F, the turkey is done.",
        "Transfer the turkey to a carving board or serving platter, and cover the breast loosely with aluminum foil. Allow the turkey to rest for 15 to 30 minutes before carving to let the juices set. While the turkey rests, finish making the Giblet Gravy.",
        "Carve the turkey (see Note). Serve, accompanied by the sauceboat of gravy or barbecue sauce.",
        "TO MAKE THE GIBLET GRAVY Begin the gravy by first making a stock out of the giblets. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Sauté the giblets until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the liver and cool for 10 minutes; then cover and refrigerate. Add the onion, carrot, thyme, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns, and 6 cups of cold water to the pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and then turn the stock to low. Skim any brown foam that rises to the top. Simmer the stock, until it reduces by half, about 1 hour. Pour the stock through a fine-mesh strainer set over a small bowl or 4-cup glass measure. Set aside the neck, gizzard, and heart until cool enough to handle. Discard the rest of the solids. Set the stock aside, and when the fat rises to the top, skim it. Shred the meat from the neck and add to the stock. Finely dice the gizzard, heart, and reserved liver, and add to the stock. Transfer to a small saucepan and set aside.",
        "Bring the stock and chopped giblets to a simmer over medium heat. Place the flour in a 1-cup measure, add a small amount of simmering liquid, and blend until smooth. Slowly pour this into the gravy and whisk until thickened, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl or sauceboat when ready to serve."

Over medium-high heat, sauté the carrots, onions, and celery in olive oil for 5 minutes to caramelize them lightly. Put the roasted bones and 5 quarts cold water in a large stainless steel stockpot and bring to a boil. Deglaze the roasting pan with a little water, vigorously scraping with a wooden spoon, and add these flavorful pan drippings to the stockpot. When the stock comes to a full boil, skim off the gray foam. Add the carrots, onions, celery, parsley, thyme, bay, peppercorns, and, if you wish, salt. Use salt sparingly if you intend to make a reduction later—the stock will become saltier as it reduces.",
        "Turn the heat to low and simmer very slowly for 4 to 5 hours, until the broth tastes rich and is a light caramel color. Strain through a finemesh colander or sieve. Allow the stock to cool completely; remove fat from the surface and promptly refrigerate. The stock is ready to use as is, or it may be reduced further to create a glaze or sauce."

Don’t worry if the beer foams up: This is normal.",

Stand the chicken up in the center of the hot grate, over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until the skin is a dark golden brown and very crisp and the meat is cooked through (about 180°F on an instant-read meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a thigh, but not touching the bone), 1¼ to 1½ hours (see Notes). If using a charcoal grill, you’ll need to add 12 fresh coals per side after 1 hour. If the chicken skin starts to brown too much, loosely tent the bird with aluminum foil.",
        "If cooking on a can: Using tongs, hold the bird by the can and carefully transfer it in an upright position to a platter.",
        "If cooking on a roaster: Use oven mitts or pot holders to remove the bird from the grill while it’s still on the vertical roaster.",
        "Present the bird to your guests. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes, then carefully lift it off its support. Take care not to spill the hot beer or otherwise burn yourself. Halve, quarter, or carve the chicken and serve."
